# GeoDeploy

A Framework for Finding a Suitable Solution for Geo-distributed Web Applications using Benchmarking	

We considered three main cloud providers 
- AWS, 
- Microsoft Azure and
- Google Cloud 

For each of the Cloud providers, we selected four datacenters located in the UK South (London), US West (Oregon), South America (Sao Paulo) and Asia Pacific (Singapore).

The data for VM cost and communication cost is given here. For communication costs, the row and column in the matrix represents the datacenter geolocation 1) UK South (London), 2) US West (Oregon), 3) South America (Sao Paulo) and 4) Asia Pacific (Singapore) respectively.
